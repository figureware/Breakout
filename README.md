# Breakout
CS50 Breakout 
Read and understand all of the Breakout source code from Lecture 2.
Add a powerup to the game that spawns two extra Balls.
Grow and shrink the Paddle when the player gains enough points or loses a life.
Add a locked Brick that will only open when the player collects a second new powerup, a key, which should only spawn when such a Brick exists and randomly as per the Ball powerup.
